## Project Summary
This Python web scraper extracts luxury property listings from LuxuryEstate.com, focusing on New York City, United States. It navigates pagination, collects unique listing URLs, and parses key details such as title, price, room counts, construction year, amenities, and views using BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and httpx for robust HTTP requests. Randomized user agents and adaptive sleep delays help reduce detection. The data collected is compiled into a Pandas DataFrame and exported as a CSV file for easy analysis or integration. Ideal for market research or data aggregation tasks and easily configurable for other cities/countries through simple variable updates.
